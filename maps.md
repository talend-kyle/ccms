# Create a map

You create maps from the toolbar by selecting __IXIASOFT CCMS__, then __Create Map__, or from the icon toolbar. Map templates are in a system configuration template folder. They are available to admins only.

The create map dialog opens. Select the map type and select __Open in DITA map editor__.

You need to add the new topic to a library version. When you do this, the topic will have a primary version value of the version you select. The primary version has no special status, but each topic must have a primary version which cannot be deleted.
